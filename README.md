# Kaggle Competition Pipeline
A pipeline that takes 8 different Kaggle competition input datasets and performs data science techniques on the sets to obtain desired results.

The row.csv files are information pertaining to each competition, which was used to create a unified pipeline and which is taken as input and parsed in order to perform competition-specific functions.

The pipeline follows a data science approach by first preprocessing the data, then performing feature extraction and/or feature selection if necessary, training a competition-specific machine learning model, and finally evaluating the model and performing any postprocessing if needed.
